# Controlling Stepper Motor Using SD02B
Sample source code for DIY PR7. Project description : This PIC microcontroller based project uses PIC16F876A to control SD02B (stepper motor driver) further drive a stepper motor (unipolar) with variable speed and bi-directionally. Start/stop instruction and CW/CCW instruction are controlled by push buttons meanwhile the speed of motor is controlled by potential meter. 

There is 3 folder which are Source code C and hex file, Sample code using MPLABX and sample code using MPLAB(Using MPLAB 8.6 And HiTech 9.80) Welcome to our tecnical forum for any inquiry.
